# Dhania

Dhania is my ongoing project, which I started in 2023. It is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI model, designed to enhance conversational interactions by providing contextually relevant responses based on the input data. Dhania leverages a robust stack of cutting-edge technologies, including Next.js, Prisma, Langchain, and prompt engineering, to achieve its goal of improving the dynamics of conversation through AI.

## Project Overview

Dhania aims to transform how conversational AI understands and responds to human input. By integrating a RAG model, Dhania is not just another chatbot. It's an AI that can retrieve and generate information that's relevant and contextually appropriate, making conversations feel more natural and informative.
